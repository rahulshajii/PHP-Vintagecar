The web application â€œVintage Car Hub" is designed to streamline the process
of managing vintage car bookings and enhance communication between
administrators and users. Administrators can add and manage vintage cars,
track availability, and oversee bookings and payments, while users have the
ability to book sessions to view or drive vintage cars and generate reports
on their booking history. The system provides valuable insights through data
analysis and reporting, ensuring a seamless and efficient experience for
both administrators and users alike.
